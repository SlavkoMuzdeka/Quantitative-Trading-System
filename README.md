# Multi-Strategy Quant Systems in Python from Scratch - A first Course in Algorithmic Trading by HangukQuant

## Quant Cycle

- There are 3 large themes to the quant cycle:

1. Alpha Research/Implementation:

- **Alpha Research:** This phase involves identifying and researching potential alpha signals. "Alpha" in finance refers to excess returnsgenerated by an investment strategy compared to a benchmark. Traders analyze historical data, market trends, and other factors to discover patterns or signals that may lead to profitable trades.
- **Implementation:** Once alpha signals are identified, traders need to translate them into executable trading strategies. This involves developing algorithms and models to automate the trading process based on the researched alpha signals.

2. Management:

- This theme likely refers to the management of the overall quantitative trading process. It includes tasks such as risk management, portfolio construction, and strategy optimization. Traders need to manage the risks associated with their strategies and ensure that their portfolio is well-balanced and aligned with their overall investment goals.

3. Execution:

- Execution is the phase where the actual trades are placed in the market based on the developed strategies. It involves implementing the trading decisions in real-time, considering factors such as market liquidity, transaction costs, and slippage. Efficient execution is crucial for realizing the intended returns from the trading strategies.

## Overview

- This repository contains Python code for a quantitative analysis system focused on fetching, organizing, and analyzing financial data. The system utilizes various libraries for data retrieval, manipulation, and statistical analysis.
